# Modified Cobblemon: PLUS!

## Requirements

* [packwiz](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz)
* [jq](https://jqlang.org/download/)

## Development

Before starting, you will need to download the Complementary + Euphoria shaders and put them in `shaderpacks`. This files are gitignored and not distributed as part of the git repo. You can get a copy of the latest ones from the [zip on CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/modified-cobblemon-plus/files/all).

`.bin/build-client` can be used to build out a zip file inside of the `build` folder that can be manually imported into a CurseForge compatible launcher or uploaded to CurseForge.
